THE MONEYBALL CASE STUDY
1. What problem did the Oakland Athletics Baseball team (popularly known as
A’s) faced?
2. How did the General Manager, Billy Beane and Assistant General Manager,
Paul DePodesta solve the problem?
3. Collect all the data relevant to the problem
4. How the A’s identified players to be bought (Refer to Sabermetrics)? Build a
suitable model.
5. Out of the identified players, some would have actually joined the team and
some would have refused. Use this data to build a predictive model which
would help the A’s in knowing in advance whether a selected player would join
or not.
Sabermetrics: DePodesta, a graduate in Economics from Harvard University
joined the A’s in 1999 and quickly started incorporating analysis of baseball
statistics to value and purchase players.
Dataset: Use the Moneyball dataset available at Kaggle.
Implement all your models in R.
Assignment Groups: Form a team of up to 3 students.
You will be provided with a presentation template in which you will need to fill
the details.
